### Self Directed Learning Path

I've been spending a lot of my time practicing more data structures and algorithms recently, primarly using C#.
I know enough about the language to write my own programs and solve any kind of problem especially with the wealth of information there is online about any particular issue. So why am I trying to practice

Things I want to express through this blog post:

- Why I'm dedicated to learning
- Why self-directed learning is important for personal development
- How to go about self-directed learning
- Additional Resources for self-directed learning
