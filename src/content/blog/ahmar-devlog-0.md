### Intro

Hello! Thank you for your interest in the development of Ahmar.

### Today's work

Involved designing the prototype, setting up the development environment and getting the resolutions fingured out.
I want to go with an internal resolution of 320x240 and the challenge is that all the art will be 1-bit art.
A couple of more things that will be new for me when undergoing this project are

### I'll be making all the music myself

So in addition to all the art, the music **and** sound design will be done by me, this won't be entirely NES faithful but i'll do my best to get all the soundscapes sounding immersive. Wish me luck!

### No photos

I don't have any development footage or photos... I suppose I have a single one but it is of just a red rectangle.
Currently what's implemented in the game is:

- The Player's movement
- Player can dash (But needs fine tuning)
- Basic Enemy that doesn't have movement or AI code yet

### Genre ?

You could say this game is a top-down arena fighter that's like a hack and slash.

**Till next time! I'll have more footage, and hopefully some concept art soon!**
