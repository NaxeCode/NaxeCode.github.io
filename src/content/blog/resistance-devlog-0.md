### On the concept of Resistance

Have you ever felt resistance towards working on a creative project? Something that you **knew** you wanted to do but just couldn't get yourself to work on?
That's me right now, I'm not sure how to go about these feelings but to try and document the process of working on this project.

### What is this game about?

This game is about the feeling of resistance in all of us, and how this feeling clouds our judgement for when we want to do something we **know** is right. Self-doubt is a big part of this, and even writing this is difficult for me right now, I'm always actively fighting resistance to achieve my goals.
I wanted to translate this feeling into a game, through the story, _hopefully_ through the gameplay.
